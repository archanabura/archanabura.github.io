<p style="font-size:90%;">
I have a doctorate from Computer Engineering and Systems Group in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, College Station. I was jointly advised by Prof. Srinivas Shakkottai, Dr. Dileep Kalathil and Prof. J-F-Chamberland. During my PhD, I worked as a Mobile Networking Research Co-Op at Nokia Bell Labs in Fall 2022.

 I obtained Masters in Engineering degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Prior to joining the PhD program, I worked as a Research Assistant at ECE Department, Indian Institute of science, with Prof. Parimal Parag. Prior to that, I also worked for Samsung R&D Institute, Bengaluru.
