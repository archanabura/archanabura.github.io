Hello, I am a post doctoral scholar specializing in algorithms and theory of reinforcement learning with application to NextG Wireless networks and beyond. I work at University of California San Diego, in the Wireless Communications, Sensing and Networking group, hosted by <a href="https://dineshb-ucsd.github.io">Prof. Dinesh Bharadia</a>.

<p style="font-size:90%;">
I have a doctorate from Computer Engineering and Systems Group in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Texas A&M University, College Station. I was jointly advised by  <a href="https://cesg.tamu.edu/faculty/srinivas-shakkottai">Prof. Srinivas Shakkottai</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil">Prof. Dileep Kalathil</a> and <a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/chmbrlnd/index.htmlProf">Prof. J-F-Chamberland</a>. During my PhD, I worked as a Mobile Networking Research Co-Op at <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com">Nokia Bell Labs</a> in Fall 2022.

<p style="font-size:90%;">
 I obtained Masters in Engineering degree from Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VGSU3YUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Vinod Sharma</a>. Prior to joining the PhD program, I worked as a Research Assistant at ECE Department, Indian Institute of science, with <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~parimal/">Prof. Parimal Parag</a>. Prior to that, I also worked for Samsung R&D Institute, Bengaluru.
