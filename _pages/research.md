Wireless communication systems are vital to modern society, forming the backbone of the digital age. Next-generation (NextG) wireless networks must support diverse applications—AR/VR, IoT, autonomous vehicles, and more—while delivering ultra-low latency, high reliability, and massive throughput. These demands, coupled with rising traffic, complexity, and energy consumption, challenge conventional optimization methods. Machine Learning (ML) offers a transformative solution, enabling dynamic adaptation, resource optimization, and real-time decision-making to meet the performance, efficiency, and sustainability needs of NextG networks.

Over the past decade, Machine Learning (ML) has transformed fields like computer vision, healthcare, finance, and telecommunications. Among ML techniques, Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at solving sequential decision-making problems by enabling agents to learn optimal strategies through interaction with their environment. From mastering strategic games to advancing chip design and aligning large language models (LLMs), RL has pushed boundaries. However, applying RL to real-world systems, such as wireless communications, poses challenges due to the need for safety, efficient learning, robustness to unseen conditions, and real-time adaptability—critical for meeting strict operational standards.

**My research focuses on designing, developing, and deploying ML and RL algorithms with provable guarantees for NextG wireless networks and systems**, addressing the fundamental challenges outlined above. My research leverages mathematical tools such as stochastic modeling, optimization, applied probability, queueing theory, and learning theory. My research also contributes to fundamental ML/RL theory, with a special focus on constrained RL, multi-armed bandits, and restless bandits. My research encompasses applications including, but not limited to, wireless edge networks, content delivery networks, and NextG cellular systems. In particular, my research focuses on the following broad questions. For more details, [check out my publications.]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/#dope)
