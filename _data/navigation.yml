# Archana-Harish: How to add a new tab such as "Publications", "Talks"
# ====================================================================
#   *Step-1*  Add a new file pages/xyz.md with following YAML front matter block,
#           where 
#             a. 'permalink' with slashes decides the URL that accesses this page on the tab
#             b. 'author_profile' indicates whether or not to show the
#           page with sidebar containing the author related info or not
# ---
# permalink: /xyz/
# title: " The name to appear in the tabs "
# author_profile: true
# ---
#
#   *Step-2*  Add the new page entry to the file: "data/navigation.yml" (this file),
#           with two JSON fields: 
# - title: xyz
#   url: /xyz/
